**Changelog**:

05/12/2019 - Added back original comments / disclaimer by Nijiko Yonskai. Ammended to them. Bumped version number. Removed extraneous line. Now doing some inspection to see if Nijiko's debugging makes sense to re-integrate.

05/12/2019 - Fixed a font detection bug that someone else should have fixed years ago. I am disappointed in the countless people who have played with and forked and modified this program.

05/11/2019 - Now detects if there is an additional GPU and displays it properly if so. Also removed some garbage like (R) and (TM) from the script's output. This saves space in the terminal and looks better. Also made clear in the script's comments that this is GPL'd software now, not MIT licensed.

05/11/2019 - Now correctly detects and displays windows theme-name instead of just pumping out the whole file path.

05/11/2019 - Forked project for bug-fix.
