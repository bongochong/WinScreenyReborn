## Getting Started
This program only works on Windows (XP to 10). Moreover, Cygwin is required for this program to work. You can run it with `sh screeny.sh`, add an alias for it in your bash profile / bashrc, or use the `install.sh` script (chmod +x it if necessary) to have it copied to your `/bin` directory. Also, please make sure your terminal screen is large enough for all the text to fit (you will know when to resize it based on the output).
