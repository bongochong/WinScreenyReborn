## Getting Started
This program only works on Windows (XP to 10).  Moreover Cygwin and the most basic packages are required for this program to work.
Once you download the shell script, chmod +x it, and then you will be able to run it.  You can use the "install" script for it (chmod +x it).  Also, please make sure your terminal screen is large enough for all the text to fit (you will know when to resize it based on the output).

## Usage
    -v                 Display script version
    -h                 Display this file
